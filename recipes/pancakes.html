            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. 
            Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; 
            cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
