        <h3>How to Make Berliners</h3>
    
        <p>
            Berliner, Krapfen, Kreppel, Pfannkuchen... there are way too many words to describe the perfection that a German donut is. 
            Fluffy, deep-fried, powdered sugar drenched and usually filled with jam!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine the luke warm milk and yeast and set aside for 5 minutes. 
                It should be bubbly. If not, start over (your milk may have been too hot or too cold). 
                In the bowl of a standmixer, combine all ingredients for the dough and knead for 10 minutes on the medium-low setting. 
                Cover the bowl and allow to rest in a warm spot until doubled in size, about one hour.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Divide the dough up into equal pieces (best to use a kitchen scale), 
                and using flour-dusted hands, shape each portion into a ball.
                 Allow to rest for another 30 minutes (covered up by a clean linen towel).
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Preheat frying oil (I prefer using avocado oil) to 160°C/320°F and bake in batches 
                (you will want the donuts to be able to swim on the surface) for about 2 ½ minutes, 
                then flip over to the other side using your strainer or slotted spoon and fry them until golden on the outside, 2 ½ more minutes.
                 I always set a timer for this. Your Berliner will fry for a total of 5 minutes.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Fill each Berliner with your favorite jam using a decorating bag and filling tip and dust with powdered sugar. 
                I also LOVE filling them with plum butter! So lecker!
            </li>
            
        </ol>
