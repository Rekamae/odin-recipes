    <h3>How to Make Baumkuchen</h3>

    <p>
        Try your hand at making our version of German baumkuchen. Popular at Christmas, 
        it's also known as 'tree cake' because of the rings you'll see when you cut into it.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the grill to medium-high, or set it to 220C if you can. 
            Butter and line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin. 
            Put the marzipan and 2 tbsp of the cream into a bowl of a stand mixer and beat for 1-2 mins with a paddle attachment until it forms a paste. 
            While beating, gradually add the rest of the cream. Tip the mixture into another bowl and set aside. 
            You don't need to clean the mixer bowl.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Put the butter, caster sugar, vanilla and a pinch of salt in the empty mixing bowl and beat for 3-4 mins until pale and fluffy. 
            Gradually beat in the creamy marzipan mixture.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Mix the egg yolks into the cake batter, one by one, then fold in the flour and cornflour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Using an electric whisk, beat the egg whites in a large bowl until it begins to form firm peaks, 
            then fold it into the cake batter so you don't knock out too much air.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Ladle just enough mixture into the cake tin to cover the base - you'll need about two-thirds of a ladle. 
            Spread the mixture evenly over the base of the tin, then cook under the grill for 3 mins until set and golden, 
            watching it carefully so it doesn't start to burn.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Remove from the grill and ladle the same amount of batter on top. 
            Spread it out in the same way, making sure that all the cake below is covered in a thin layer. 
            Cook again for 3 mins. Continue until all the batter is used. 
            It should make about 10 layers, depending on the thickness.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            When it's finished cooking, run a small paring knife around the edge of the tin to stop it from sticking, 
            and leave to cool completely. Remove the cooled cake from the pan and invert onto a cooling rack.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            To make the glaze, heat the chocolate, cream, syrup and butter together in a saucepan until melted together into a smooth, 
            glossy sauce, about 1-2 mins. Pour over the top of the cake and down the sides, 
            then leave to set fir 1 hr before serving.
        </li>
